# BuildoutAnalysis

## Overview
A tool for calculating buildout numbers for parcels in NJ under current zoning and NO3 dilution standards. 
- Created using a model outline from the NJ DEP
- Calculates numbers for existing areas, and for areas that are left over after environmental constraints are erased
- "CANSPLIT" field makes for easy display of parcels that can and cannot be divided
- Run time under 10 minutes for rural municipalities, have not tested on larger ones yet

## Updates needed
- Wider support for various zoning laws (these change with every municipality)
- Though not slow, anything to make the program run faster would be appreciated
